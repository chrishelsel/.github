## Chris Helsel

I work in nonprofit finance and accounting in Anchorage, Alaska, helping mission-driven organizations build financial systems that are clear, structured, and reliable. I care deeply about the role thoughtful financial practices play in supporting strong missions and informed leadership.

I’m also someone who genuinely enjoys technology — not just the tools themselves, but the process of learning, building, and understanding how things work. I believe the future of finance will belong to people who can combine practical accounting experience with modern, thoughtful systems. GitHub is where I explore that intersection, sharpen my skills, and contribute what I can to the wider community.

I’m also building **Snow River Advisory**, a fractional CFO + Controller practice for nonprofits. Its GitHub home is here:
