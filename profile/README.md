# Chris Helsel

I work in nonprofit finance and accounting, helping mission-driven organizations build financial systems that are clear, structured, and reliable. I care deeply about the role that thoughtful financial practices play in supporting strong missions, informed leadership, and long-term organizational health.

I’m also someone who genuinely enjoys technology — not just the tools themselves, but the process of learning, building, and understanding how systems fit together. I believe the future of finance will belong to practitioners who blend practical accounting experience with modern, well-designed systems. GitHub is where I explore that intersection and continue developing the technology and systems side of my work.

I’m currently building **Snow River Advisory**, a fractional CFO + Controller practice for nonprofits. Its public GitHub home is here:
